Chapter 1: The Forgotten Scientist

You wake up on the cold floor of a dim lab. The room is filled with broken equipment and dust, and a strange emptiness fills your mind. You don’t know who you are or how you ended up here. A desk nearby holds open notebooks filled with strange formulas and notes.

Suddenly, you hear footsteps approaching from behind a door.

Choices:

Investigate the desk - (You may uncover clues about your identity).
Confront the footsteps - (You may meet someone or something important).
Escape through a window - (You might get out, but risk danger).
Try to remember - (You may recall important details, but could waste time).

Psychological Tracking:

Memory Recovery: The more the player uncovers, the more they learn about the scientist’s past.
Trust vs. Suspicion: How much the player trusts others will affect interactions.
Empathy: The player’s choices will shape how compassionate or self-centred the scientist becomes.
Stress Level: High stress may affect decision-making or limit options.
